Hyperledger Besu as an alternative
Regulatory requirements

Why Besu?
Ethereum-compatible (like Quorum, so no major rewrites needed)
Open-source & vendor-neutral (some people hesitate over Quorum’s JPMorgan origins)
Supports permissioned networks (fits your state-regulated stablecoin model)
Privacy features (similar to Quorum’s private transactions)
Backed by Hyperledger (IBM, ConsenSys, and other major players, so it's enterprise-grade)

Wyoming’s Stablecoin Needs a Practical Path to Success
Wyoming has a massive opportunity to become the regional financial hub, but over-specifying technical minutiae is a common failure point in emerging tech. A better approach is outcome-focused, not rigidly technical.

My proposed model:
✅ State Treasury-first approach – Integrates with Wyoming’s existing financial infrastructure.
✅ Private blockchain (likely Quorum) – Meets regulatory requirements while avoiding public chain risks.
✅ Off-chain transaction processing with periodic blockchain settlement – Ensures regulatory confidence and smooth adoption.
✅ Scalable multi-depository framework – Future-proofed for cash, gold, and digital assets.

This strategy delivers a stablecoin that actually works, while keeping Wyoming in control. I’m offering to advise independently, not as a consultant maximizing billable hours—just a direct, workable solution Wyoming can actually implement.

1. True Randomness
2. Off-Chain Data Integration (Without Oracles)
3. Self-Amendment (Smart Contract Upgrades)
4. Complex Loops & Recursion
5. Direct Interaction with Traditional Financial Systems (Banks, SWIFT, ACH)
6. Private Transactions (Confidentiality)
7. Subjective Decision-Making (Human Judgment)
8. Complex AI & Machine Learning
9. Large data storage
