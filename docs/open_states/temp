This is an example roadmap featuring several legislative crypto acts / pending bills organized into a comprehensive structure. 

New Hampshire Crypto Commission, HB 310

West Virginia State Bank, HB 2464
Technical Working Group

Wyoming Stable Token, Senate Act 85
Arkansas Bullion Depository, Act 810
Texas Oil-based Stablecoin, SB 2922
New Hampshire Digital Asset Act, HB 302
Louisiana Interoperation, HB 695
State Exchange System

After reading through proposed State legislation, I realized that most of the crypto-related bills are singular and self-contained, which is also how I envisioned this STP project.   But now I think this roadmap is better for most situations because itâ€™s a strategic approach with a single source of direction (Crypto Commission) and reduces complexity and duplication.
